'''
Your function should take in a single parameter (a string `word`)
Your function should return a count of how many occurences of ***"th"*** occur within `word`. Case matters.
Your function must utilize recursion. It cannot contain any loops.

def count_th(word):
    # hold string in variable
    
    # base case is when we reach nth in our word
    
    # when nth letter is found return true

    # else return false
    pass
