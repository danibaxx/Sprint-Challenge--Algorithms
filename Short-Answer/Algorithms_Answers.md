#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Constant O(1) - This example is O(1) because no matter what n is, it is completely unaffected by the size of the input.

b) Linear O(n) - This example is O(n) because the input size will increase and the runtime will grow with it.

c) Exponential O(c^n) -  This example is O(c^n) because as the input increases, the runtime will grow at a faster rate.
